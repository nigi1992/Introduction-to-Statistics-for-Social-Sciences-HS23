## Data ðŸ—ƒ
I used data from Freedom House from the URL: https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/2023-02/Aggregate_Category_and_Subcategory_Scores_FIW_2003-2023.xlsx. 
And the World Bank: https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?downloadformat=excel &
https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD?downloadformat=excel. Let me know, if you want the raw data.
The Input data is in the main repo in the Main Folder. The most important one is saved as "fh_pop_gdp.csv".
The Output data is in the "Output Data" Folder.

## Scripts ðŸ’»
You'll find my scripts in the folder Â«scriptsÂ».
"Test file for Github.R" and "test file 2 for Github" is for Github Repo Setup.
"Data Preparation.R" contains code regarding the preparation of the raw data.
"Statistical Analysis.R" contains the most important code for the statistical analysis and also includes the regression tables.
"Data Visualization.R" contains the plotted maps of Switzerland with the data integrated.

## Figures ðŸš€
You'll find my plotted figures and regression tables in the folder Â«OutputÂ». 

## R Markdown
The R Markdown is saved as "FinalAssignment.Rmd" in the "Report" folder.
There you'll also find it as a HTML file under "FinalAssignment.html"
Please consult the R Markdown document though, as it contains code chunks that display the generated plots and data.
